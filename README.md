<h1>Absenteeism_dataset</h1>
<p>Creating a logistic regression to predict the chances of employee absenteeism</p>
<h2>Preprocessing</h2>
<p>Inside the preprocessing is the original dataset and the method I used to preprocess the data before a logistic regression</p>
<h2>Model</h2>
<p>The model was then trained on the preprocessed dataset after scaling variables other than the dummies through a custom scaler and the scaler is saved in the scaler file and model in the model file.</p>
<br>
<p>hen I created a python module to use to load and clean data before putting it through the regression to predict if they were more likely to be absent over 0.5 and gained the probabilities and in the integration I show it being deployed and saving the new outputs in a csv file</p>
<h2>Tableau</h2>
<p>I then visualised some of the data in tableau</p>
